-x An input file that has the node id followed by the position values.

-a An input file that has the node id followed by the position values, denoting the anchor nodes.

-m An input file that has the node id followed by the mass values.

-t The number of threads to spawn. This is capped by 100. If not provided, the value 1 will be used.

-i The maximum number of iterations. 250000 by default.

-s The Special Spring Constant (the value of k in F=-kx for special interactions). 10 by default.

-k The Casual Spring Constant (the value of k in F=-kx for casual interactions). 10 by default.

-r The neighborhood radius for each particle. It defines the interaction range for casual (generally repulsive) interactions. 1 by default.

-T The time step for each iteration. 0.001 by default. This is used as the time interval of force application on each iteration to determine the position adjustment of a particle.

-S The 'radius' of each node. 0.01 by default.

-M The 'mass' of each node. 1 by default.

-R The radius of the outer perimeter. If not provided, the Nth root of the nodes count will be used, where N is the number of dimensions (either 2 or 3).

-W The write interval. This is the number of iterations between consecutive stats dumps. 0 by default, meaning off.

-z Id of the root node you want to use. If not provided, the root node will be attempted to be determined automatically.

-o Path of the output file. If not provided, "lgl.out" will be used.

-l Write out the edge level map, to a file having path <output-file>.edge_levels .
   Each time this option is provided, it toggles the prior value of this setting of whether to write out the edge level map or not.
	The output indicates which 'level' each edge is on. The level is determined as the hop number from the root node. 

-e Output the mst used - the tree used to guide the layout, to a file having path <output-file>.mst.lgl .

-O Use original weights. If this option isn't provided, the weights will be generated from negative adjacent vertex count.

-y Layout the tree only.

-I Don't show layout progress, be quiet (kinda)

-q The equilibrium distance. If two particles are closer to each other than this distance, then they will repulse each other. 0.5 by default.

-E Ellipse factors. The format is one or more real numbers, separated from each other by the 'x' character.
   Each number indicates the stretching factor to use for the corresponding dimension. If the count of the provided factors is less than the count of dimensions,
	then the last provided factor will be used as the factor for subsequent dimensions too.
   This is used to stretch the layout by the given factors, resulting in an ellipse-looking image rather than a circle-looking one.

-u Placement distance, which is the distance you want the next level to be placed with respect to the previous level.
   If this float value is not given, then a formula calculates the placement distance.

-v Placement radius is a measure of the placement density. If not provided, the value 0.1 will be used.

-L Place the leafs close by. This applies to trees more than graphs.
   Setting this option will place the child vertices very near the parent vertex if all of its children have none themselves.

-D Remove from processing the uninitialized-position nodes that are disconnected from the larger graph,
   even if those nodes are connected to each other between themselves.
   Currently only supported if the -x option is provided too, otherwise will have no effect.
